# Developing ConfigSync

## Debugging

In the profile you test in, set `debug_enabled = true` in `doorstop_config.ini`, and `debug_suspend = true` if the game
should wait for the debugger at start-up. Start the game, then run Attach to Lethal Company in VS Code (Mono Debug
extension) or Rider (Mono Remote on 127.0.0.1:10000). Debug builds include symbols, so breakpoints work.

## Publishing

Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag publishes from CI with the `THUNDERSTORE_API_TOKEN` secret, once the build passes. To publish from your own computer,
create a service account token for the team on Thunderstore (Settings, Teams, Service Accounts) and store it once.
Mortar's Develop tab stores it in the same place when you upload from there.

- Linux: `secret-tool store --label "Thunderstore Mortar" service thunderstore username Mortar`, then paste the token.
- Windows: `Install-Module CredentialManager`, then
  `New-StoredCredential -Persist LocalMachine -Target 'thunderstore:Mortar' -Password <token>`.

Then run `dotnet build -c Release -p:PublishTS=true`. Don't add `-bl` or `-v:d` to a publish build: MSBuild logs task inputs, and the token is one.
